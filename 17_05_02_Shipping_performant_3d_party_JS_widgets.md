3d party perfomant widgets: twitter buttons, chat windows, etc. 

- simple integration - merely a script tag that looks for a signature 

- average SPA ships 420kb js, spends 5s in startup.. Parse time - often overlooked
## HOW TO SPEED UP WIDGETS (w/ minimal effort)

###Stack 
- babel
- webpack
- https://github.com/th0r/webpack-bundle-analyzer (visualization of the code you are shipping- shows you where to cut fat)
- yarn (much!!) faster than npm  (example: 2.5 mins in npm, 20 seconds w/ yarn)
###Example: widgets.js (2.1 mb)

###webpack -p (427kb)
- automatically minifis using uglifyJS
- shims process.env.NODE_ENV = "production" for dead-code removal 
* uglify js will ignore all the development/test stuff that isn't useful for production 
https://webpack.js.org/

###Compression-webpack-plugin (134kb)
- configurable, compressed bundles w/ Gzip
- https://github.com/webpack-contrib/compression-webpack-plugin
`` plugins: [
	new CompressionPlugin({
	test: /\.(html|js)$/
	})
	]
``
###Tree Shaking (109kB)
- babel-plugin-lodash
- tree shaking bundles hte named imports vs. an entire CommonJS module
- https://webpck.js.org/guides/tree-shaking 

###Preact (71.2kB)
- preact-compat is a drop-in replacement for react 
- use webpack's resolve.alias
- current version 8
- there were issues w/ preact 7
- changes dom renderer, changes differ - whole encihilada
- compatability layer
- big preformance improvement, non-technical users will appreciate the âˆ†
`` resolve: {
	alias:{
		react: "preact-compat",
		"react-dom": "preact-compat"
	}
}``

###Code Splitting (31kb for widgets.js)
- automatically splits dynamic imports 
- built in webpack 

###Targeted Polyfills (6.54kB)
- bundle and ship code to majority of your users based on their browser stats
- lazy-load additional polyfills for uncommon browser targets
- this makes performance super quick for super users w/ most up to date tech 
- figure out what browsers have marketshare 
- ship to chrome first...
