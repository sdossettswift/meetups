## Scar Tissue: Lessions from Leading in Chaos and Ambiguity 
[lawyer joke ] 

###Scar Tissue: every mistake left a mark. The key is looking at the scars and finding behavior changing moments. 
- We are no strangers to risk. Leading in a risk filled environment requires building cohesive teams, in an environment of unknowables. 
- 21st century workforce - desire to be connected, have a sense of purpose, know *why* they are doing something 
- Iraq: enemy changed. Vehicles needed new armour. They showed the mechanics the *PROBLEM* and show them *WHY* and they were able to come up with great solutions, in half of the time expected. Great motivation -> better innovation 
- study: what is it that makes a strategic leader?
- researched based, scar tissue filtered opinion: harden your soft skills - strenghten the foundation of the soft skills
### Enterprise vision, intellectual curiosity, humility, courage, empahty, selflessness
## Eneterprise Vision
- Essence of leading and following at the same time. Daily actions are with the overall purpse of the larger organization in mind. 
- The mission of putting a man on the moon permeated down to the janitorial staff of NASA :) 
- Use this in decision making, course of action, strategy meetings -- how does this fit wih our mission? DOes this fit with our mission. 
- Only works if it is a clear mission. 
- Here's what life will be like and how these cuts will impact our mission... Be strategic. Put things into context of enterprise vision. 
## Intellectual Curiosity
- willingness to learn new things
- childlike
- leadership attitudes open to new approaches
- tolerance for things that are different. 
- gut check: how do you know what you know? scartissue: singlesource newsfeed -- [i'm guessing fox news] he recognized the rut and climbed out

## Selflessness
- 21st century workforce demands selfless leadership 
- essence of servant leadership
- reflexive trigger w/ in a leader that puts themself last 
- military: leaders eat last -- builds a muscle memory of selflessness, builds tolerance of being first to take the bad medicine. Took a vaccine in front of the troops. 
- make decisions based on what is best for org, not you. 
- seek every opportunity to help a peer
- 2 young pilots flying above big helicopter to protect it

## Humility
- understanding that you are not the most important thing
- sometimes you have to relearn it
- leave it better than you found it, the legacy is the people 
- allows you to accept criticism 
- just take the shot. listen to understand, not to respond
- internal guardrail to the consequences of power 
- grounded against weakness
- always carry your bag, get your own coffee

## Courage
- moral courage
- courage to confront
- when people are looking away, the leader is staring at the uncomfortable thing in the face, doing somethign about it 
- confrontational leaders necessary 
- scartissue: uncomofortable laughter at an off color joke, doing nothing 
- courage to impose reason over impulse
- get over imposter syndrome. sometimes you have to lead your leaders, this takes courage. 

## Empathy (most important of all)
- ability to understand others
- apply it naturally, universally
- willingness to form teams 
- think of people as  indiviudals when making group decisions
- scartissue: 1980 - ft hood -  107degree heat - took a minute but gave them water, shade, etc. 
- take care of people by putting yourself in their shoes.
- bottom line: you can't help but be a better mentor by being empathatic
- life as you climb (!)

### Social Economics
- for the last 40 years, there has been a movement we call globalization. 
- focus: lowest cost solution sold into highest cost market. 
- BUT - we are now understanding that this has left enormous pockets of human misery & discontent 
- social economic traps we now have to deal with -- what context are we going to deal w/ it?
- central banks estimated to have provided liquidity ~ 100T 
- single entry accounting -- just creating money -- the  balance sheet is going to have to be unwound
- we in the US are ~ 25% of the world GDP - when we sneeze, everyone gets a cold
- the funded deficit in the US is ~ 18T. GDP is ~18T. Ratio is ~ 1:1 
- scary thing: unfunded liabilities estimated at 60-70 trillion 
- we owe ourself 10% of the GDP of the world
- in VC -- this would call for massive restructuring
- we will be forced to redo our social compact (!!)
- debate: what happens now? 
-- for the first time in history of US - the establishment (primarily political infrastructure) has been replaced by a combo of commercial & security competencies in 1 location  (kushner,  mcmaster), this has consequences
--- all multilateral institutions post WW2 (UN, NATO, EU, etc.) promoting globalization are now under severe stress from evolving nationalist/populist impulses
--- stress, possible change of form. most talked about - EU (brexit), Germany, France may follow... 
--- The state of capital markets --> UNCERTAINTY 

### Geopolitics

### The State of Global Capital Markets
- uncertainty 
- risk premium  ^ 
- stock market should fall 
- why is it that capital markets are at an all time high?
- wunwinding of globalization? unwinding of multilateral institutions --> less efficient economy (more labor, more capital, more inefficient logistics)
- inefficiecy is going to be good for the world b/c of new jobs 
- MOAB - Afghanistan is on the rocks. US is not minding the store. ISIS is gaining toehold in Afghanistan. 
- Syria - multinational force (100K+) to keep peace (?)
- markets have forseen major strive 
- Hypothesis: increasing economic activity (jobs/wars) outpace effect of uncertainty 
- sigmas 
- get educated on megatrends
