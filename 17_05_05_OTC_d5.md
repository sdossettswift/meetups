## Scar Tissue: Lessions from Leading in Chaos and Ambiguity 
[lawyer joke ] 

###Scar Tissue: every mistake left a mark. The key is looking at the scars and finding behavior changing moments. 
- We are no strangers to risk. Leading in a risk filled environment requires building cohesive teams, in an environment of unknowables. 
- 21st century workforce - desire to be connected, have a sense of purpose, know *why* they are doing something 
- Iraq: enemy changed. Vehicles needed new armour. They showed the mechanics the *PROBLEM* and show them *WHY* and they were able to come up with great solutions, in half of the time expected. Great motivation -> better innovation 
- study: what is it that makes a strategic leader?
- researched based, scar tissue filtered opinion: harden your soft skills - strenghten the foundation of the soft skills
### Enterprise vision, intellectual curiosity, humility, courage, empahty, selflessness
## Eneterprise Vision
- Essence of leading and following at the same time. Daily actions are with the overall purpse of the larger organization in mind. 
- The mission of putting a man on the moon permeated down to the janitorial staff of NASA :) 
- Use this in decision making, course of action, strategy meetings -- how does this fit wih our mission? DOes this fit with our mission. 
- Only works if it is a clear mission. 
- Here's what life will be like and how these cuts will impact our mission... Be strategic. Put things into context of enterprise vision. 
## Intellectual Curiosity
- willingness to learn new things
- childlike
- leadership attitudes open to new approaches
- tolerance for things that are different. 
- gut check: how do you know what you know? scartissue: singlesource newsfeed -- [i'm guessing fox news] he recognized the rut and climbed out

## Selflessness
- 21st century workforce demands selfless leadership 
- essence of servant leadership
- reflexive trigger w/ in a leader that puts themself last 
- military: leaders eat last -- builds a muscle memory of selflessness, builds tolerance of being first to take the bad medicine. Took a vaccine in front of the troops. 
- make decisions based on what is best for org, not you. 
- seek every opportunity to help a peer
- 2 young pilots flying above big helicopter to protect it

## Humility
- understanding that you are not the most important thing
- sometimes you have to relearn it
- leave it better than you found it, the legacy is the people 
- allows you to accept criticism 
- just take the shot. listen to understand, not to respond
- internal guardrail to the consequences of power 
- grounded against weakness
- always carry your bag, get your own coffee

## Courage
- moral courage
- courage to confront
- when people are looking away, the leader is staring at the uncomfortable thing in the face, doing somethign about it 
- confrontational leaders necessary 
- scartissue: uncomofortable laughter at an off color joke, doing nothing 
- courage to impose reason over impulse
- get over imposter syndrome. sometimes you have to lead your leaders, this takes courage. 

## Empathy (most important of all)
- ability to understand others
- apply it naturally, universally
- willingness to form teams 
- think of people as  indiviudals when making group decisions
- scartissue: 1980 - ft hood -  107degree heat - took a minute but gave them water, shade, etc. 
- take care of people by putting yourself in their shoes.
- bottom line: you can't help but be a better mentor by being empathatic
- life as you climb (!)

## You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet
- acute sensitivity for passage of time b/c of granddaughters
- personal obvseravtions
- Lahore | 1977 | biz school @ Mississippi State 
- Dr. Shiela Neuremberg - lightrays from retina -> binary code - compression  - COMPUTER VISION - Neurenberg Neuroscience
### Social Economics
- for the last 40 years, there has been a movement we call globalization. 
- focus: lowest cost solution sold into highest cost market. 
- BUT - we are now understanding that this has left enormous pockets of human misery & discontent 
- social economic traps we now have to deal with -- what context are we going to deal w/ it?
- central banks estimated to have provided liquidity ~ 100T 
- single entry accounting -- just creating money -- the  balance sheet is going to have to be unwound
- we in the US are ~ 25% of the world GDP - when we sneeze, everyone gets a cold
- the funded deficit in the US is ~ 18T. GDP is ~18T. Ratio is ~ 1:1 
- scary thing: unfunded liabilities estimated at 60-70 trillion 
- we owe ourself 10% of the GDP of the world
- in VC -- this would call for massive restructuring
- we will be forced to redo our social compact (!!)
- debate: what happens now? 
-- for the first time in history of US - the establishment (primarily political infrastructure) has been replaced by a combo of commercial & security competencies in 1 location  (kushner,  mcmaster), this has consequences
--- all multilateral institutions post WW2 (UN, NATO, EU, etc.) promoting globalization are now under severe stress from evolving nationalist/populist impulses
--- stress, possible change of form. most talked about - EU (brexit), Germany, France may follow... 
--- The state of capital markets --> UNCERTAINTY 

### Geopolitics

### The State of Global Capital Markets
- uncertainty 
- risk premium  ^ 
- stock market should fall 
- why is it that capital markets are at an all time high?
- wunwinding of globalization? unwinding of multilateral institutions --> less efficient economy (more labor, more capital, more inefficient logistics)
- inefficiecy is going to be good for the world b/c of new jobs 
- MOAB - Afghanistan is on the rocks. US is not minding the store. ISIS is gaining toehold in Afghanistan. 
- Syria - multinational force (100K+) to keep peace (?)
- markets have forseen major strive 
- Hypothesis: increasing economic activity (jobs/wars) outpace effect of uncertainty 
- sigmas 
- get educated on megatrends

## How Our Technology Choices Will Create The Future

### this is the most amazing, most scary period of human history
- didn't ever imagine mad max would arrive as quickly as it did
- this is fear. this is mad max. 

### How to go to star trek
- unlimited food, driverless cars,  perfect health, all wants and needs met
- massive unemployment, dependent on robots, massive surveillance 
-  today: track, recorded; tomorrow: dna hacks, etc. 
- we can have madmax or star trek future -- 15 years in future, 300 years ahead of schedule 
- we are currently on an exponential curve; the past is no longer indicitave of the future
- moore's law -- calculations/second for $1000: 2050 - power of all human brains 
- 2023- power of the human brain 

- AI, Robotics, nano, synthetic biology, genomics, vr, digital medicine, 3d priniting etc

### What are the choices we must make?
- Does the tech have hte potential to benefit everyone equally?
- Do the rewards outweigh the risks?
- Does tech more strongly promote autonomy or dependence? 
 - every technology can be used for both good and evil

### Robotics
- Rosie (Jetsons), 3CPO, Wall-E ... ew have been dreaming abotu this. 
- voice recogniztion, face recognition, speech, sophisticated movements... 
- Asimo (Honda) - a year away from commercialization 
- taking over pharmacy, retail, etc... 
- but we are getting older (more over 65 than under 5)
- what rights does Rosey have? Can she defend herself? Do robots get to vote? Will they be used for destructive purposes? 
- we can't stop robots. 
- majority of jobs @ risk
- needed: kill switches, encryption, etc. 
- equal benefit and dependence? 
- Jobs can't be saved
- we are already dependent 

### Medicine
- we are becoming data
- soon, tag on panties will be a sensor to monitor function 
- massive amounts of data - intimiate data collection points
- Ai >> doctors in analyzing body function -- ability to manipulate and analyze better datasets  (by 2020)
- Genome + microbiome- Cost per genome is quickly outpacing Moore's law
- designer genes + amateur genetics
- download | print custom designed medicine, tissues, bacteria
- genomic medicine ** Caroline ** healthcare tialiored to individual
- the next frontier: microbiome
- bacteriaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa 
- microbiome takes us back to holistic health (-> back to aruyveda) 
- fecal transplants -> Chron's cured... by a "shit cocktail"
- late 2020s: medicine based on genetic profile, microbiome, lifestyle, history... 
- risks: poor medical decisions by inexperienced, vitual doctors, ai doctors, genomic data mandatory for all -- how do we protect this? 

### Synthetic Biology
- creation of super humans 
- computer designed virus used to cure disease
- bateria capable of producing unlimited fuel
- biohazards
- writing DNA is getting cheaper
- dna printed 2010 - 
- CRISPR: editing living things  
- 2014 - china genetically modified monkeys
- april 2015 - china edits genes of human embryo
- april 2016 - edit hiv (china)
- nov 2016 - CRISPR used to treat cancer in human (china)
- CRISPR - $50 editing - potential to eradicate all hereditary disease 
- where do we draw the line? 20/20 vision? high IQ? perfect pitch, athletic ability, etc
- when do we lose our humanity? 
- CRISPR editing is legal currently -- we just can't use federal funds to do the research -- but it is so cheap, fed funds aren't necessary 
- pandora's box of national security problems, bioterrorism, etc. 
- Wadhwa: urged for moratorium on gene editing in wapo 
- Bionic enhancements - possible, probable, soon. the bionic man is here. Steve Austin - Six Million Dollar Man -> will become $600 man. circa 2030
- where is the line between human and machine? organs, prothesis, etc... 

### AI
- AI - used everywhere. 
- we need AI - reduce medical error --- this can be wiped out by AI. 1/3 of causes of death
- today: narrow AI - siri, ibm watson, etc. 
- tomorrow: ex machina
- later on: superintelligent species
- Samantha (Her) is not that far away. Alexa is close. People propose to Siri all the time. 
- Problematic: we are summoning the demon (Elon Musk)

risk/reward
dependence/autonomy
equalizers

### Self driving cars
- will be devestating to drivers 
- fewer cars
- safety 
- cars will own us
- more freedom/autonomy 
- immerse lifestyle change 

# Humanity's Great Challenges 
- no.1 reason behind wars, det. fossil fuels 
- swanson's law
- installations of solar are doubling 
- us isnt driving progress
- china, india, the rest of the world.. 
- solar energy is only six doublings away from generating 100% of today's energy needs (!!!) 
- the challenge: storage costs -- which are dropping rapidly
- assumptions and analysis are based on linear change, but this is an exponential curve
- it is going to happen. 


read: The Driver in the Driverless Car (already ordered it on amazon) 

# Q & A 
- cloning - 
- the chinese have made AI a big priority
- apple ai is lacking, failing to the chinese
- china is leading the world in science 
- carnage across the board in the next decade 
- what career should we choose? what should we study? 
- there is an obsession with STEM, but humanities are really the biggest value bringers 
- let your children love to learn 
- what is going to happen to nations 90% dependent on fossil fuels? disaster brewing. 
- price of oil -> under $10/barrel in 2020s - 99.9% probability. near certainty
