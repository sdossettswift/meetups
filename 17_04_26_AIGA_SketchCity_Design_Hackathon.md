### DESIGNERS AS: TEAMMATES || EXPLORERS || COMMUNICATORS || SHAPERS 
### Team Formation (Neeraj)
1) define and agree on a (broadly defined) problem
2) communicate! (And then focus on doing the right work)
3) figure out skills & interests
4) identify a subject matter expert

### Design Thinking Mindset
- Empathize
- Embrace ambiguity
- Make it
- Iterate! 
- Learn from failures
- Think in terms of MVP

### Design Thinking
#### STEP 1. Understanding
#### STEP 2. Defining Problem
#### STEP 3. Ideation
#### STEP 4. Prototype
#### STEP 5. Testing


#### HOW MIGHT WE... 
- Why? In order to.. 
- WHy? So that we might...

- HOW? By...
- HOW? 

#### IDEATION + SCOPING 
- Everyone gets a pack of sticky notes 
- Categorize stickynotes 
- Map them out -- show solutions and how they are related 


#### EVALUATE BY PLOTTING 

2 x 2 Matrix
FEASABILITY
DESIRABILITY 

Sort the stickies into that matrix


### QUALITIES OF WELL SCOPED PROJECTS
- competitive analysis -- see what's out there via google,etc. 
- subject matter expert -- the subject matter experts show up at the tuesday night events
- verified users -- ask the subject matter expert -- the project is not for you 
- realistic evaluations -- impact & complexity
- firm timeline -- plot, break them down, be realistic, set goals & milestones 
- success criteria -- at different stages of the hackathon, after 

* foundation build w/ first 3 before the hackathon

## DESIGNERS AS COMMUNICATORS 

Brand strategy 
Questions to ask: 
 1) Who is target audience?
 	-- privacy pref, age, marital status, tech saviness, gender, ethnicity, language?
 2) What language would your buyers be most effected by? (Personal, how it will effect your family/friends/health, etc)
 3) What images are your targets attracted to/ deterred from? 
 4) Who are your allies? 
 5) What name speaks to both your target audience & allies? 

## In the future things will be kicked adn shook to work
