# intro to clojurescript
- clojure complied to js
	- clojure typically compiles to java
- functional language - 
 - no state. things change b/c of functions, not b/c of state or mutation
 - js can be functional... but is not functional 
- dynamically typed
- lisp syntax 
- language != runtime, although they are often

## why clojure?
- simple, practical 
- stable, flexible syntax (future proof)
 - instead of re-writing source code, features are just added as new libraries 
 - no wierd conventions *looking at you, js* 
- powerful core library
- persistent data structures as default
- awesome community  (smart && nice)
- great video on clojure: **Simple Made Easy** - Rich Hickey  [https://github.com/matthiasn/talk-transcripts/blob/master/Hickey_Rich/SimpleMadeEasy.md]
- ** wtf is a monad? **

### why clojurescript?
- language level state mgmt
- build system is part of the lang
- leverages the best of google closure toolchain
- flexible syntax: HTML, async, React
- stable 
- great video on cljs: ClojureScript for Skeptics - Derek Slager
