# intro to clojurescript
- clojure complied to js
	- clojure typically compiles to java
- functional language - 
 - no state. things change b/c of functions, not b/c of state or mutation
 - js can be functional... but is not functional 
- dynamically typed
- lisp syntax 
- language != runtime, although they are often
## why clojure?
- simple, practical 
- stable, flexible syntax (future proof)
 - instead of re-writing source code, features are just added as new libraries 
- powerful core library
- persistent data structures as default
- awesome community 
- great video on clojure: **Simple Made Easy** - Rich Hickey
